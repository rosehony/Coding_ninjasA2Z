 if-else (Decision Making)

You are given two numbers 'a' and 'b'.
Compare the numbers and print the relation.
Print “smaller”, “greater” or “equal” when ‘a’ is smaller than ‘b’, greater than ‘b’, or equal to ‘b’ respectively.

Example :
Input: ‘a’ = 5 and ‘b’ = 3

Output: greater

Explanation: Since ‘a’ (= 5) is greater than ‘b’ (= 3), we are printing “greater”.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
5 3
Sample Output 1:
greater
Explanation of sample input 1 :
Since ‘a’ (= 5) is greater than ‘b’ (= 3), we are printing “greater”.


Sample Input 2:
2 2
Sample Output 2:
equal
Explanation of sample input 2 :
Since ‘a’ (= 2) is equal to ‘b’ (= 2), we are printing “equal”.

Expected time complexity :
The expected time complexity is O(1).
Constraints :
-10 ^ 5 <= ‘a’ <= 10 ^ 5
-10 ^ 5 <= ‘b’ <= 10 ^ 5

Time limit: 1 second

solution:

public class Solution {
    public static String compareIfElse(int a, int b) {
        if(a>b)
        {
            return "greater";
        }
        else if(a<b)
        {
            return "smaller";
        }
        else
        {
            return "equal";
        }
    }
}
