solution

public class Solution {
    public static void nStarTriangle(int rows) {
         for (int i = rows - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Print spaces before the stars
            for (int j = 0; j < rows - i - 1; j++) {
                System.out.print(" ");
            }

            // Print stars
            for (int k = 0; k < 2 * i + 1; k++) {
                System.out.print("*");
            }

            // Move to the next line
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
